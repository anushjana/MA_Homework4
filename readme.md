Social Network Analysis 

In this repository I've done Social Network Analysis.
My job focuses on analyzing a social network using graph theory and a few network analysis techniques. 
Based on the analysis done on connections.txt data, I am providing some insights and visualizations.
You can see the whole analysis done on the given data in SNA_AA.ipynb.
